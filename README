Project: SimpleProxy
Author: Nolan Caudill
Date: 2010/11/24

This is a simple HTTP proxy written in PHP. There are a few variables
that you will want to redeclare (like the referrer sniffing one). There's
also a function that reads the headers of the requested file that you
can also change to allow/disallow more content types. 

The goal was a proxy that mirrors the headers sent. One interesting note
is that this project uses PHP's custom stream objects so that the requested
file is not loaded in memory (or disk) at one time. The stream object prints
its data as soon as receives it, holding on to nothing.
